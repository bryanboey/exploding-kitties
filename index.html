                    <h4>HOW IT WORKS</h4>
                    <p>In the deck of cards are some Exploding Kittens.
                        You play the game by putting the deck face down and take turns 
                        drawing cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten.</p>
                    <p>When that happens, that person explodes. They are now dead and out of the game.
                    This process continues until there’s only 1 player left, who wins the game.</p>

                    <p>BASICALLY, IF YOU EXPLODE, YOU LOSE.</p>

                    <h4>TAKING YOUR TURN</h4>
                    <p>Gather all 5 of your cards into your hand and look at them. Do one of the following:</p>
                    <p>1a. PASS - Play no cards OR<br>
                    1b. PLAY - Play a card by placing it FACE UP on top of the Discard Pile. You can play as many cards as you’d like</p>

                    <p>2. End your turn by drawing a card from the Draw Pile into your hand and hope that it’s not an Exploding Kitten. You END YOUR TURN by drawing a card.</p>
        
                    <h4>ENDING THE GAME</h4>
                    <p>The last player who hasn’t exploded wins the game.</h4>
                    
                    <h4>CARDS</h4>
                    <h5>>EXPLODING KITTEN</h5>
                        You must show this card immediately. Unless you have a Defuse Card, you’re dead. 
                        (Exploding Kitten is inserted back randomly after defusal)

                    <h5>>DEFUSE</h5>
                        If you drew an Exploding Kitten, your Defuse Card will automatically be placed into Discard Pile and Exploding Kitten Card will be randomly inserted back (for now).

                    <h5>>ATTACK</h5>
                        Do not draw any cards. Instead immediately force the next player to take 2 turns in a row. Play then continues from that player. The victim takes a turn as normal (pass-or-play then draw). When their first turn is over, It’s their turn again.

                        The victim of an Attack Card may play an Attack Card and the new victim will have to take 2 turns instead.

                    <h5>>FAVOR</h5>
                        Randomly steals a player’s card from their hand.

                    <h5>>NOPE</h5>
                        Stop action cards such as Skip and Attack Cards (for now). May not be used against Exploding Kitten and Defuse Card.

                    <h5>>SHUFFLE</h5>
                        Self explanatory. Reshuffles the draw pile.

                    <h5>>SKIP</h5>
                        Immediately end your turn without drawing a card. If you play a Skip Card as a defence to an Attack Card, it only ends 1 of the 2 turns. 2 Skip Cards would end both turns.

                    <h5>>SEE THE FUTURE</h5>
                        View the top 3 cards from the Draw Pile.<br><br>
